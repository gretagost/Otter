# Otter

Hi!

I create this repository to collect all R scripts I used in my researchs on Eurasian otter (_Lutra lutra_).

Particularly, I analysed otter's diet using DNA metabarcoding, and their genetic diversity and population structure.

For the first aim, I create:

1. "Metabarcoding db" - a script to download GenBank 16S and 12S sequences, in order to creare a customized database;
2. "Remove primers" - to identify and remove primer sequences with cutadapt in R;
3. "Assign taxonomy dada2" - to assign taxonomi to fastq files starting from the customized database with dada2 package;
4. "Population genetics" - to analyse genetic diversity and population structure with different R packages.
